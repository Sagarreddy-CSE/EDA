# 🧑‍💻 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects  

Welcome to my collection of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects!  
This repository contains hands-on projects where I analyse different datasets, perform data cleaning, visualisation, and statistical exploration to uncover meaningful insights.

## 📌 Overview  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Explore datasets with descriptive statistics  
- Visualise trends, distributions, and correlations  
- Highlight insights through structured analysis  
- Use Python libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly**
